              Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in
              a football match, didn't you? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! You hit me with a cricket bat. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying
              to make you feel better?
